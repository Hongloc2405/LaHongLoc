## API Service Specification for the Scoreboard Module

### Introduction
This module is responsible for handling the user scores on the website’s scoreboard. The module should track the users' scores, update them securely, and provide real-time updates to all users viewing the scoreboard. It should also prevent unauthorized score manipulation attempts.

### Functional Requirements
1. **Score Update**:
   - Upon completing a user action (external to this module), the system should dispatch an API call to the backend to update the user’s score.
   - The backend will receive a request containing the user ID and the updated score.

2. **Live Update**:
   - Once the score is updated, the backend should broadcast the updated score to all clients viewing the scoreboard in real time.
   - The live update should utilize technologies like WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE), or long-polling.

3. **Malicious Activity Prevention**:
   - The API will include authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only legitimate actions can update the score.
   - Users must be verified to ensure their actions are valid before updating the score.
   - Use techniques such as API keys, JWT, or OAuth for securing the API.

4. **Scoreboard Retrieval**:
   - The backend will provide an API endpoint to retrieve the top 10 users’ scores.
   - The list should be sorted in descending order, showing the highest scores at the top.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The system should return appropriate error codes and messages in case of issues, such as:
     - Invalid user ID.
     - Unauthorized access.
     - Internal server error.

### API Endpoints

#### 1. **POST /api/score/update**
   - **Description**: Updates the score of a user after they complete an action.
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "string",    // User's unique identifier.
       "score_increase": "int" // The amount by which the score is to be increased.
     }
     ```
   - **Response**:
     - **200 OK**:
       ```json
       {
         "message": "Score updated successfully",
         "new_score": 1234
       }
       ```
     - **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters (e.g., invalid `user_id`).
     - **401 Unauthorized**: The user is not authorized to perform this action.
     - **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred while updating the score.

#### 2. **GET /api/scoreboard/top**
   - **Description**: Retrieves the top 10 users’ scores for the scoreboard.
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "top_scores": [
         { "user_id": "user1", "score": 9999 },
         { "user_id": "user2", "score": 8950 },
         ...
       ]
     }
     ```

#### 3. **WebSocket for Live Updates**:
   - **Description**: Provides real-time updates to clients viewing the scoreboard.
   - **URL**: `wss://<backend_url>/scoreboard/updates`
   - **Message Format**:
     ```json
     {
       "user_id": "user1",
       "new_score": 10000
     }
     ```

### Security and Authorization
1. **Authentication**: 
   - Ensure each API request to update the score is authenticated (via JWT, API key, or OAuth).
   
2. **Authorization**: 
   - Verify that the authenticated user has permission to update the score (based on the user's session, role, or action).

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - To prevent abuse, the backend should enforce rate limits on how often a user can update their score.
   
4. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensure that all incoming data, especially the `user_id` and `score_increase`, is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

5. **Logging**:
   - Log every score update attempt for auditing purposes, including the user’s action, timestamp, and the success/failure status.

### Performance Considerations
1. **Caching**:
   - Cache the top 10 scoreboard results to reduce database load, with cache invalidation upon score updates.
   
2. **Scalability**:
   - The API should be horizontally scalable to handle many concurrent score updates, especially when the website grows in traffic.

### Additional Improvements/Considerations
1. **User Feedback**:
   - Upon a successful score update, the frontend should display a message indicating the new score, enhancing the user experience.
   
2. **Retry Logic**:
   - Implement retry mechanisms in the API for updating scores in case of temporary failures, ensuring that legitimate updates are not lost.
   
3. **Leaderboard Pagination**:
   - For large datasets, consider paginating the leaderboard to avoid returning too much data at once.
   
4. **Security Audits**:
   - Regularly audit and test the system for security vulnerabilities, especially around score manipulation and unauthorized API access.

# Scoreboard Module API Documentation

## Overview
This module is designed to manage and display user scores in real-time. Users can complete actions which update their scores, and the top 10 scores are displayed on the scoreboard. The module ensures that only authorized users can update scores and provides live updates to all viewers.

## Endpoints

### POST /api/score/update
Updates the score of a user.

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "score_increase": "int"
}
```

#### Response
- **200 OK**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Score updated successfully",
    "new_score": 1234
  }
